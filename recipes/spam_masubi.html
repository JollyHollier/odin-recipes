        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>You don't need to fly to Hawaii to try this tasty, authentic Hawaiian Spam Musubi. With this 
                easy recipe, you can make it yourself at home!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>12 ounces Spam</li>
                <li> 1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
                <li>Nori roasted seaweed used for sushi, cut into halves or thirds (I cut it into thirds to 
                    make it go further)</li>
                <li>6 cups cooked sushi rice WITHOUT the vinegar mixture added (Click HERE for the Sushi Rice 
                    Recipe)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice the SPAM into about 8-10 slices (depending on how thick you like it) and put in a 
                    Ziplock bag. Mix oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sugar until sugar is dissolved and add to 
                    the bag with the SPAM. Marinate for about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Drain off marinade and fry SPAM on each side over medium heat until slightly crispy or 
                    until desired doneness. Some people like to glaze the SPAM with the marinade/sauce AFTER 
                    frying, either way tastes great! </li>
                <li>Place a strip of nori on a cutting board or clean surface (shiny side down). Place your 
                    Musubi mold across the middle of the nori.</li>
                <li>Add Sushi Rice to the mold, pressing down firmly and evenly so there is about 1-1 Â½ inches 
                    of rice. Dip the mold and your fingers in water as you go to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Optional: Add a sprinkling of furikake (a mixture of sesame seeds and little bits of nori) 
                    for extra flavor.</li>
                <li>Next, remove the mold from the rice. Now you will have a nice little block of rice right on 
                    the nori. Add some of the cooked SPAM to the top. Wrap up one side of the nori and stick it 
                    to the top of the SPAM, then wrap up the other side. Just like you are wrapping a nice little 
                    package. Use a little water on your finger to seal if needed. Serve warm.</li>
                <li>Some like it dipped in soy sauce, some like it with ketchup, and some like it as is.</li>
            </ol>
