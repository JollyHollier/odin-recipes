            <p>Juicy tomato, crispy lettuce, smoky bacon, and a garlicky mayo spread. What more could you

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 strips of bacon</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
                <li>Grated garlic to taste</li> 
                <li>Pinch of black pepper</li>  
                <li>2 slices lightly toasted white sandwich bread</li>  
                <li>1 large green leaf lettuce leaf (or Bibb, romaine, or iceberg)</li> 
                <li>About 2 1/4-inch-thick beefsteak tomato slices</li> 
                <li>Kosher salt</li> 
                <li>Pepper</li>     
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until golden and 
                    crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels, and drain. Stir 
                    together mayonnaise, grated garlic to taste, and a pinch of black pepper in a small bowl. 
                    Spread evenly on bread slices. Top 1 slice of bread with lettuce leaf, breaking to fit 
                    if necessary, and tomato slices. Sprinkle tomatoes with salt and pepper. Top with bacon 
                    and remaining bread slice. Slice sandwich in half before serving.</li>
